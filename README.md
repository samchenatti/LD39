# Ludum Dare 39 Entry

The game was first conceptly to be a small project between me and my friends, made in just 72 hours, but it quickly became something bigger than pygame can handle.

# How to run

Just run Game.py

# Controls

*Keys*  - Moves the player
*A key* - Punch/action/interaction

# About the code

As expected for a 72 hour game jam, the code is a giant mess. I have developed a game engine that fits well our project scope, and can easily extended to another small projects. Unfortenally, it have some performance issues due to PyGame core limitations.
